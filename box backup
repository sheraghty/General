# How to back-up from uahpc to box 

# ssh into uahpc from terminal and navigate to directory where the setup file is located (called .mylftp). 

lftp #This activates lftp
source .mylftp 

#Should now be in box and can navigate to the Back-up directory

mirror -R -c # this uploads files from uahpc into box and the -c flag causes it to pick from where it left off

#Note this can be a long process so best to do it in a different terminal tab
#Note box is limited to files under a certain size so particularly big files need to be broken up or backed up else where
