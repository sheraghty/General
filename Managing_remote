#Some helpful bits of code for managing remote unix servers 

#To run multiple jobs at once without using a workload manager like SLURM, there are several options.
#1) Pushing jobs to the background which can be done like ./my_script.sh &
#  a) In order to keep running this script, even if the shell is closed do the following 
    nohup ./myscript.sh &

#2) Using a program like screen
#Create screen using this command: screen -S testscreen
#List the screen using this command: screen -ls
#Attache the screen using this command: screen -r testscreen
#Attache the multipurpose screen using this command (if already others are attached with the same screen): screen -x testscreen
#Detach the screen using this command: screen -X detach OR Ctrl+a+d
#Kill the screen using this command: screen -XS testscreen kill
#Terminate the attached screen using: Ctrl+d


#In order to see what jobs are running use the following
#ps -ef | grep "my_username"
#Note: grep is optional, but useful if there are other users

#In order to kill jobs do the following 
# kill JOBID
# Note: JOBID can be obtained from the ps -ef command
